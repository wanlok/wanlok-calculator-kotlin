This is an app I developed to practise MVVM with data binding and Google Firestore.

I also notice a few pain points in calculator apps available in Google Play and App Store. Therefore, I decided to write my calculator app and make it open-source.

1. The main user interface shows operand vertically, user can remove any line by swiping them to the right

3. Users can view conversion of their choice other than subtotal
