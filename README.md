This is an app I developed to practise Android MVVM with data binding and Google Firestore.

I also notice a few pain points in calculator apps available in Google Play and App Store. Therefore, I decided to write my calculator app and make it open-source.

1. The main user interface display operands vertically, user can remove any lines by swiping them to the right

2. Users can convert numbers into units maintained on Firestore.
